Project Description

The Schedule Planning Website will welcome users with an aesthetically pleasing 

interface, which allows them to browse and search for classes that they wish to register 

for. Users may “backpack” classes and see their projected schedules for the upcoming 

semester. Users will also be able to explore classes by term, school, and subject in 

order to narrow down their search.


Reach Features

Improve User Interface Using CSS (2 points)

We will be styling the schedule planning website with CSS. After searching for classes, the courses matching the parameters will be in a standard row format similar to what can be found within wolverine access, but ‘lighter’ i.e. less information. The contents of this standard row format, which will be the results of different applied filtering and searches, will be:

Term Description
School Description
Subject Description
Course Name
Section Number / Course Day & Time

Each of the items above will have it's own row. The CSS piece comes in in the styling of these rows and their content. All pages/tables will have the same theme/colors to create a more seamless flow between pages.

Allow users to "backpack" classes (3 points)

Users will be able to add courses to a ‘backpack’ by clicking an “Add to Backpack” button after they narrow their class search to a specific section. The actual ‘backpack’ will be an unsaved portion of the site that will display a list of the courses added and their days/times.
